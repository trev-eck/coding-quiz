The bulk of the websites functionality revolves around the use of querySelector's to monitor and make changes to HTML elements and its contents, as well as eventListener's to check for button clicks to progress the quiz and submit information.

The biggest challenge of this project was finding the correct way to get/set multiple objects in an array to local storage, sort these objects by a selected property, and then display them on the screen when requested.

## Future Improvements
In its current state the website is not very visually attractive, with much of the focus being on the functionality of the Javascript and not the appearance through CSS. Future updates could focus on adding images and music to go along with each question.
